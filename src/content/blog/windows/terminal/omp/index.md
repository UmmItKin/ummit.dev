   ```powershell
   Set-PoshPrompt -Theme theme_name
   ```

   Replace `theme_name` with the actual name of the theme you selected.

   b. **Option 2 - oh-my-posh init**:
   Alternatively, you can use the following command to select a theme and apply it directly to your current terminal session:

   ```powershell
   oh-my-posh init pwsh --config $env:POSH_THEMES_PATH\<theme_name>.omp.json | Invoke-Expression
   ```

   Replace `theme_name` with the actual name of the theme you selected.
