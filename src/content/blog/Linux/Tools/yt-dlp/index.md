## Introduction

This guide walk you through the command-line tools of yt-dlp, a utility for downloading videos and audio tracks from various streaming platforms. yt-dlp offers a wide range of features, including video format selection, audio extraction, chapter handling, subtitle management, and more.

## Simple and Straightforward Video Download

For a quick and straightforward video download without additional commands, use the following:

```bash
yt-dlp [video URL]
```

## Listing Video Formats

To view available video formats and their details, you can use the following command:

```shell
yt-dlp -F [video URL]
```

This command provides a detailed list of available formats, including resolution, file size, codecs, and more. The output helps you choose the desired format for your download.

### Targeting Specific Format ID

After listing the available formats, you can target a specific format ID to download the video in that format. Higher numbers generally indicate better quality:

```shell
yt-dlp -f 248+251 [video URL]
```

This command selects the video (ID 248) and audio (ID 251) formats, merging them into a single file.

### Targeting Specific Extension Type

If you prefer a specific extension type, such as mp4, you can use:

```shell
yt-dlp -f mp4 [video URL]
```

This command filters the formats to include only those with the mp4 extension, simplifying your download preferences.

## Extracting Audio from a Video

Sometimes, you might only be interested in the audio content of a video, especially for music tracks. to extract the audio from a video, use the following command:

```bash
yt-dlp --extract-format --audio-format mp3 [video URL]
```

This command tells yt-dlp to extract the audio ( `--extract-format` or `-x`) and convert it to the MP3 format (`--audio-format mp3`).

## Batch Downloading with list

Batch downloading can be useful when you want to download multiple videos in one go. You dont need to one-by-one paste to one command. Here's how you can achieve this with yt-dlp:

```bash

```
