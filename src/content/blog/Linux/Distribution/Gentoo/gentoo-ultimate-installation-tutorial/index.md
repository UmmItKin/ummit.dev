## Introduction

Gentoo Linux is a distribution known for its flexibility, performance, and robustness. In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of installing Gentoo Linux step by step. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Gentoo Linux system ready for your customization.

>Notes: This article has only the most basic settings.

## Prerequisites

Before embarking on the exciting journey of installing Gentoo Linux, it's essential to ensure you have everything you need:

- **Linux Proficiency:** You should be comfortable with Linux, know How linux working. and have experience with tasks like installing Arch Linux. While Gentoo is known for its flexibility, don't know how the command working, otherwise the installation will be very painful. I think it will take at least one week to several weeks to install..

- **Stable Internet Connection:** Gentoo requires downloading various packages and the Stage3 tarball during installation. Ensure you have a reliable and reasonably fast internet connection to expedite this process.

- **Hardware or Virtual Machine:** Prepare a physical machine or set up a virtual machine (VM) where you intend to install Gentoo. Whether it's real hardware or a virtual environment, Gentoo can adapt to your choice.

- **CPU cores:** There are many CPU cores. You need to know that everything in Gentoo is built using source code and not pre-built, so the cpu is very important as it depends on the compilation speed of your computer.

Now, let's get started with the installation process:

1. **Visit the Official Gentoo Website:** Open your web browser and navigate to [gentoo.org](https://www.gentoo.org/).

![Download ISO](./Download-iso.png)

2. **Download the Minimal Installation CD:** On the Gentoo download page, locate the "Minimal Installation CD (amd64)" option and click to initiate the download of the Gentoo ISO image.

With these prerequisites addressed,  Lets Boot your ISO on your machine!

## Step 1: Initial Setup

Before delving into the installation process, there are a few critical preliminary steps to ensure a smooth Gentoo Linux installation:

### Choose Keyboard Layout

As you boot up the Gentoo Linux ISO, your first decision is to select the appropriate keyboard layout. The default setting is a US keyboard layout. To confirm this choice, simply press Enter.

### Verify Internet Connectivity
```shell
ping gentoo.org
```
To begin the Gentoo installation, it's crucial to confirm that you have a working internet connection. You can quickly check this by running the following command. A successful response indicates that your network connection is functional and ready for the installation process.

### List Available Block Devices
```shell
lsblk
```
To proceed with the installation, you need to identify the specific storage device where you'll install Gentoo. The `lsblk` command provides a comprehensive list of available block devices on your system. Take note of the device you intend to use for the Gentoo installation.

### Initialize GPT Partition Table

Now, let's initialize the GUID Partition Table (GPT) on your chosen device:

```shell
gdisk /dev/vda
```

Once inside the `gdisk` utility, follow these steps:

1. Type "o" to create a new GPT partition table. Please note that this action will erase all existing data on the selected device.

2. Press "n" to create a new partition. Specify the partition type as "ef00" (EFI system partition) and allocate a size of at least +1G. This partition is essential for EFI booting.

3. Use "n" once more to create another partition. Search for "swap" by specifying the code "8200" and allocate at least +10G in size for the swap partition.

4. Again, press "n" to create a partition. This time, allocate the remaining space for it. This partition will serve as the root filesystem.

5. Confirm the partition table by typing "p" to review its contents. Ensure that all partitions have been created correctly.

6. If everything appears as expected, save your changes by typing "w." This action will write the new partition table to all partitions.

When defining partition sizes during GPT initialization, the `+` notation allows you to add space to the existing size.

Upon completion, your partition layout should resemble the following example (based on my configuration):

| Number   | Size                 | Code | Name                 |
|----------|----------------------|------|----------------------|
| 1 (vda1) | +1G (1024.0MiB)      | ef00 | EFI system partition |
| 2 (vda2) | +10G (9.0 GiB)      | 8200 | Linux swap           |
| 3 (vda3) | All Remaining Space (90.0 GiB) | 8300 | Linux filesystem     |

This sets the stage for the partitioning of your device to host the Gentoo Linux installation.

## Step 2: Partitioning

In this step, you will create and format the necessary partitions for your Gentoo installation. These partitions will serve distinct roles, including EFI booting, housing the core filesystem, and providing swap space.

### Format EFI Partition

To ensure your system supports EFI booting, the EFI partition needs to be correctly formatted with the FAT32 file system. Use the following command:

```shell
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/vda1
```

This command prepares the EFI partition (/dev/vda1) with the FAT32 file system, a requirement for EFI-based booting.

### Format Root Partition

The root partition is where the core Gentoo filesystem will reside. Format it with the Btrfs file system using this command:

```shell
mkfs.btrfs /dev/vda3
```

By running this command, you're configuring the root partition (/dev/vda3) with the Btrfs file system, a modern and flexible choice for managing your Gentoo installation.

### Create Swap Partition

Swap space is essential for memory management in your system. Begin by initializing the swap partition with this command:

```shell
mkswap /dev/vda2
```

This command prepares the swap partition (/dev/vda2) for use in your Gentoo system.

### Enable Swap

Activate the swap partition to make it available for use in your system:

```shell
swapon /dev/vda2
```

This step ensures that your Gentoo installation can effectively manage system memory.

### Create a Mount Point

Before proceeding, create the required directory structure for your Gentoo filesystem:

```shell
mkdir --parents /mnt/gentoo
```

This command establishes the necessary directory structure within the `/mnt` directory, specifically the `/mnt/gentoo` directory, which will serve as the mount point for your Gentoo installation.

### Mount the Root Partition

Now, it's time to associate the root partition with the mount point:

```shell
mount /dev/vda3 /mnt/gentoo
```

By executing this command, you're linking your Gentoo root partition (/dev/vda3) with the `/mnt/gentoo` directory. This association allows you to access and configure the contents of your Gentoo installation within this directory. It's a pivotal step in setting up your Gentoo Linux system.

## Step 3: Setting the System Clock

Now, ensuring your system's clock is accurate is crucial. An incorrect system time can cause download errors and lead to issues post-installation. Here's a quick guide on how to verify and set the date and time in Gentoo.

### Checking Current Date and Time

Firstly, check your system's date and time by running the date command:

```shell
date
```

if the displayed date and time are significantly off, it needs to be corrected.

### Automatic Time Sync

Automatic time synchronization using a time server is the best option. Gentoo's official live environments include the `chronyd` command, which can sync your system clock to UTC time using a time server. (`ntp.org`) Note that this method requires a working network configuration.

>Warning: Automatic time sync reveals your system's IP address to the time server.

```shell
chronyd -q
```

### Manual Time Setting

The date command can manually set the system clock. Use the following format: `MMDDhhmmYYYY (Month, Day, Hour, Minute, and Year)`.

```shell
date <MMDD><hhmm><YYYY>
```

Set the system clock to the current date and time by replacing `<MMDD><hhmm><YYYY>` with the appropriate values.

#### Example for Setting day

To set the date to Friday October 20, 16:40:

```shell
102016402023
```

Now, it’s time to download Stage3 Tarball.

## Step 4: Downloading the Stage3 Tarball

### Navigate to the Installation Directory

Begin by changing your working directory to `/mnt/gentoo`, which is where you'll install Gentoo. This location serves as the foundation for your Gentoo Linux system.

```shell
cd /mnt/gentoo
```

### Download the Stage3 Tarball

The Stage3 tarball is a crucial component of your Gentoo installation, containing the base system files. To obtain it, we'll use the text-based web browser called `links`. Follow these steps to access the official Gentoo website and download the Stage3 tarball tailored to your architecture:

1. Launch `links` by typing `links` into the terminal and pressing Enter.

2. In `links`, enter `g` to access the URL prompt, and then type the URL for [gentoo.org](https://www.gentoo.org/).

3. Once you've entered the Gentoo website, navigate to the Stage3 tarball download section. Look for the appropriate Stage3 OpenRC file corresponding to your architecture (e.g., amd64).

4. Select the desired tarball file, initiate the download process, and save it to your system.

5. After the download completes successfully, exit the `links` program by pressing `ctrl+c`.

## Step 7: Repository Configuration

In this step, we establish the necessary configuration for managing package repositories using Portage, Gentoo's package manager. This allows you to define additional repositories beyond the defaults.

### Create the repos.conf Directory

To begin, create the `repos.conf` directory within the `/mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/` path:

```shell
mkdir --parents /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf
```

This directory is crucial for housing repository configurations.

### Copy Default Repository Configuration

Next, duplicate the default Gentoo repository configuration to ensure Portage can locate software packages. Execute the following command:

```shell
cp /mnt/gentoo/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf
```

This command copies the default repository settings from their typical location in `/usr/share/portage/config/repos.conf` to the specific location `/mnt/gentoo/etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo.conf`. By doing this, you provide Portage with the necessary information to access software repositories.

## Step 8: Network Configuration files

Same, In Gentoo network configuration is not set up by default, so you'll need to configure it manually to ensure proper network connectivity within your Gentoo environment. Follow these steps to set up your network.

### Copy the Host System's resolv.conf

Begin by copying the DNS resolver configuration from the host system to your Gentoo environment:

```shell
cp --dereference /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/gentoo/etc/
```

The `/etc/resolv.conf` file on the host system contains essential DNS resolver settings, enabling domain name resolution. By copying it to `/mnt/gentoo/etc/`, you ensure that Gentoo can also resolve domain names correctly. This step is crucial for maintaining consistent and reliable internet connectivity within your Gentoo installation.

Setting up network configuration correctly is essential for various system functions and software package management. This step ensures that your Gentoo environment can access the internet and external resources as needed.

## Step 9: Mounting System Directories

In this section, we mount essential system directories within the Gentoo environment. These directories play critical roles in the functioning of the Linux system.

### Mount /proc

```shell
mount --types proc /proc /mnt/gentoo/proc
```

The `/proc` directory provides a virtual filesystem that exposes information about running processes and the kernel's internal state. Mounting it within the Gentoo environment is essential for various system utilities and commands to retrieve process-related information.

### Mount /sys

```shell
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/gentoo/sys
mount --make-rslave /mnt/gentoo/sys
```

The `/sys` directory offers a view into the kernel's internal data structures and provides a way to interact with device drivers and kernel parameters. By mounting `/sys` with the `--rbind` option and making it a slave of `/mnt/gentoo/sys`, we ensure that the Gentoo environment can access kernel and hardware information, facilitating system configuration and management.

### Mount /dev

```shell
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/gentoo/dev
mount --make-rslave /mnt/gentoo/dev
```

The `/dev` directory is crucial for device interaction. It contains special files representing hardware devices and facilitates device-related operations. Mounting `/dev` with the `--rbind` option and making it a slave of `/mnt/gentoo/dev` ensures that the Gentoo environment can access and manage devices effectively.

### Mount /run

```shell
mount --bind /run /mnt/gentoo/run
mount --make-slave /mnt/gentoo/run
```

The `/run` directory is essential for the proper functioning of various system services and daemons. It stores runtime information, including sockets and process IDs. Mounting `/run` and making it a slave of `/mnt/gentoo/run` ensures that system services within the Gentoo environment can operate as expected, contributing to a smoothly running system.

## Step 10: Chrooting into the New Environment

Now that your Gentoo system is prepared and mounted, it's time to enter the new environment and start configuring it further, Follow these steps to chroot into the new environment:

### Enter the Chroot Environment

Execute the following command to enter the chroot environment, where you will perform system configurations and installations:

```shell
chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash
```

This command initiates a process called "chrooting," which stands for "change root." It allows you to transition into the newly installed Gentoo environment as if it were your root directory. After running this command, any further commands you execute will affect the Gentoo environment, not the host system.

### Apply Profile

After entering the chroot environment, it's essential to load the system-wide profile settings from `/etc/profile`. This step ensures that all necessary environment variables and system configurations are in place, allowing you to work effectively within the Gentoo system. Execute the following command:

```shell
source /etc/profile
```

This command ensures that the profiles are applied correctly to your newly installed Gentoo system.

Chrooting into the new environment is a critical step in the Gentoo installation process, as it allows you to perform essential configurations and installations within the Gentoo environment itself. It's the point at which you transition from setting up the installation environment to configuring the actual Gentoo system.

## Step 11: EFI Partition (UEFI Users)

Now, is time to mount your EFI Partitoin for your `/boot`, this important for your booting into your gentoo system. Follow these step:

### Create the EFI Directory

For users installing Gentoo on a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) system, creating the EFI directory is a crucial preparatory step. Here's what each component means:

- `mkdir /efi`: This command creates a directory named "efi" at the root of the file system. This directory will serve as the mounting point for the EFI system partition (ESP).

```shell
mkdir /efi
```

UEFI-based systems use the EFI system partition to store bootloader files and related information required for the boot process. By creating this "efi" directory, we establish the location where we will later mount the EFI partition.

### Mount the EFI Partition

After creating the "efi" directory, we proceed to mount the EFI partition onto this directory:

```shell
mount /dev/vda1 /efi
```

- `mount /dev/vda1 /efi`: This command instructs the system to mount the EFI partition, which is typically identified as `/dev/vda1`, onto the `/efi` directory. Mounting the EFI partition in this way ensures that the UEFI firmware can locate and access the necessary bootloader files and configuration data during the system's boot process.

In summary, this step is crucial for UEFI-based systems, as it sets up the directory structure and mounting point needed for successful UEFI booting, allowing Gentoo Linux to start correctly in such environments.

## Step 12: Initial Configuration

In this step, we'll perform the initial configuration for your Gentoo system. Synchronizing your file system.

### Synchronize Portage Tree

On your first Gentoo installation, it's essential to synchronize your Portage tree database. You can achieve this by running the following command:

```shell
emerge-webrsync

The `emerge --depclean` command helps free up disk space and improve system performance by removing packages that are no longer needed after the update.

## Step 14: Licensing

Software licenses play a crucial role in Gentoo, as they determine which software can be installed based on your acceptance or rejection of these licenses. By default, Gentoo requires you to manually configure your license preferences. Here, we'll set up Gentoo to accept all licenses, but you can customize this based on your preferences.

### Edit make.conf

To customize your license acceptance preferences, you need to add a line to your `make.conf` file. You can do this using a single command or by manually editing the file.

#### Option 1: Adding the Line Automatically

Run the following command to add the necessary line to your `make.conf` file:

```shell
echo 'ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```

This command appends the line `ACCEPT_LICENSE="*"` to your `make.conf` file, which indicates that you accept all licenses for packages. It allows you to install any software without being restricted by license agreements. However, please exercise caution and ensure that you comply with the licenses of the software you install, as some licenses may have specific requirements.

#### Option 2: Manual Editing

Alternatively, you can manually edit your `make.conf` file and add the following line:

```shell

1. **Install Firmware Packages:**

   ```shell
   emerge --ask sys-kernel/linux-firmware
   ```

   Start by installing the necessary firmware packages required for effective hardware support. These packages provide essential firmware files for various hardware components.

2. **Intel CPU Microcode (Optional):**

   ```shell
   emerge --ask sys-firmware/intel-microcode
   ```

   If you have an Intel CPU, consider installing Intel microcode updates. These updates enhance CPU performance and security by addressing microcode vulnerabilities. Ensure that your CPU is supported before installing this package.

### Install Gentoo Kernel

3. **Install Gentoo Kernel:**

   ```shell
   emerge --ask sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel
   ```

   Install the Gentoo kernel, a critical component of your Gentoo Linux system. The kernel serves as the core of the operating system, providing essential hardware support and system functionality.

4. **List Available Kernels:**

   ```shell
   eselect kernel list
   ```

   List the available kernels to help you select the appropriate one for your system. This step is crucial to ensure that you choose the correct kernel configuration that matches your hardware and requirements.

Installing firmware and the Gentoo kernel is vital for the proper functioning of your Gentoo Linux system, ensuring that it's equipped with the necessary hardware support and system core.

## Step 18: Filesystem Configuration

In this step, you will configure your filesystem by editing the `/etc/fstab` file, which contains information about how various partitions are mounted and used by your system.

### Edit /etc/fstab

Open the `/etc/fstab` file for editing using a text editor, such as Nano:

```shell
nano /etc/fstab
```

Inside the `/etc/fstab` file, add entries for different partitions based on your system configuration. Here's an example of what the entries might look like:

```shell
# EFI Partition
/dev/vda1   /efi        vfat    defaults    0 2

# Swap Partition
/dev/vda2   none        swap    sw          0 0

# Root Partition
/dev/vda3   /           btrfs   defaults,noatime  0 1
```

Here's an explanation of each entry:

1. `/dev/vda1` is mounted at `/efi` and uses the VFAT filesystem.
2. `/dev/vda2` is designated as a swap partition.
3. `/dev/vda3` is mounted as the root directory and uses the Btrfs filesystem. It also specifies mount options, such as "defaults" and "noatime."

Ensure that you adjust these entries to match your actual disk partitioning and filesystem choices. Properly configuring `/etc/fstab` is essential for ensuring that your system mounts and utilizes partitions correctly during startup and operation.

## Step 19: Setting Network Information

In this step, you will configure network-related settings to ensure proper communication and connectivity on your Gentoo Linux system. Each command provided is independent of the others.

### Edit the Hosts File

```shell
nano /etc/hosts
```

- `nano /etc/hosts`: Use this command to open and edit the `/etc/hosts` file. This file is responsible for mapping hostnames to IP addresses and is crucial for network communication.

Add the following lines to the file:

```shell
127.0.0.1   gentoo   localhost
::1         localhost
```

These lines define the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`) and the IPv6 loopback address (`::1`) with corresponding hostnames. The "gentoo" hostname is associated with the loopback address.

### Set the Hostname

```shell
echo gentoo > /etc/hostname
```

- `echo gentoo > /etc/hostname`: Use this command to set the hostname of your Gentoo system. In this example, the hostname is set to "gentoo." Make sure to replace "gentoo" with your desired hostname if needed.

### Install and Configure DHCP

```shell
emerge --ask net-misc/dhcpcd
```

- `emerge --ask net-misc/dhcpcd`: This command installs `dhcpcd`, a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client, which is essential for automatically configuring network interfaces.

```shell
rc-update add dhcpcd default
```

- `rc-update add dhcpcd default`: Add `dhcpcd` to the list of services that start automatically at boot. This ensures that the DHCP client service runs during system startup, enabling automatic network configuration.

```shell
rc-service dhcpcd start
```

- `rc-service dhcpcd start`: Use this command to start the `dhcpcd` service immediately. It will configure network interfaces and establish network connectivity.

By following these steps, you've configured network-related settings on your Gentoo Linux system, including hostname setup, host file editing, and the installation and configuration of a DHCP client for automatic network configuration. Your system should now be ready to communicate over the network.

## Step 20: Network Configuration

Configuring your network correctly is essential for proper system functionality. Follow these steps to configure your network interfaces in Gentoo:

### Identify Network Interfaces

Use the following command to identify the names of available network interfaces on your system, including both active and inactive interfaces:

```shell
ifconfig -a
```

This command will display a list of network interfaces, helping you determine the correct interface name that you need for configuration.

### Configure Network Interfaces

Edit the network interface configurations in the `/etc/conf.d/net` file to suit your specific network requirements. You can use a text editor like Nano for this purpose:

```shell
nano /etc/conf.d/net
```

Inside the `/etc/conf.d/net` file, configure your network interfaces as needed. For example, you can set up DHCP for your Ethernet interface or configure static IP addresses. Here's an example configuration for DHCP:

```shell
config_enp1s0="dhcp"
```

Replace "enp1s0" with the actual name of your network interface. Adjust the configuration based on your network setup.

### Create a Symbolic Link

Navigate to the `/etc/init.d/` directory, which is used for managing system services:

```shell
cd /etc/init.d/
```

Create a symbolic link for your network interface, simplifying its management:

```shell
ln -s net.lo net.enp1s0
```

Replace "enp1s0" with the actual name of your network interface.

### Start Network Interface at Boot

Ensure that the network interface starts automatically with the system by adding it to the default runlevel:

```shell
rc-update add net.enp1s0 default
```

Make sure to replace "enp1s0" with the correct interface name for your system configuration.

By following these steps, you'll properly configure your network interfaces in Gentoo, ensuring that they start automatically and provide stable connectivity for your system.

## Step 21: Setting the Root Password

Securing your Gentoo system starts with setting a strong and secure root password. The root account is a powerful administrative account that should only be accessed by authorized users when necessary. Follow these steps to set the root password:

### Set Root Password

To set a secure root password, use the `passwd` command:

```shell
passwd
```

After entering this command, you'll be prompted to enter and confirm your new root password. Make sure to choose a password that is both strong and memorable. A strong password typically includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It's important to keep this password confidential and not share it with unauthorized users.

Setting a strong root password is a critical security measure for your Gentoo system, as it helps protect your system from unauthorized access and ensures that only trusted users can perform administrative tasks.

## Step 2: File System Support

To effectively manage various filesystems on your Gentoo system, it's important to have the necessary tools and utilities installed. This step focuses on installing `sys-fs/btrfs-progs` and `sys-fs/dosfstools` to support Btrfs and DOSFAT filesystems, respectively. Follow these instructions to ensure you have the required filesystem support:

### Install Btrfs Tools

[Btrfs](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a modern and feature-rich filesystem that offers benefits like snapshots and data integrity. To manage Btrfs filesystems on your Gentoo system, you'll need the `btrfs-progs` package. Use the following command to install it:

```shell
emerge -av sys-fs/btrfs-progs
```

This command will install the Btrfs tools, enabling you to create, manage, and maintain Btrfs filesystems on your Gentoo installation.

### Install DOSFAT Tools

DOSFAT (also known as FAT) is a filesystem format commonly used for removable storage devices such as USB drives and SD cards. To interact with DOSFAT filesystems on your Gentoo system, you'll need the `dosfstools` package. Use the following command to install it:

```shell
emerge -av sys-fs/dosfstools
```

Installing `dosfstools` provides utilities like `mkfs.fat` for formatting DOSFAT filesystems and `fsck.fat` for checking and repairing them.

With both `sys-fs/btrfs-progs` and `sys-fs/dosfstools` installed, your Gentoo system will have comprehensive filesystem support, allowing you to work with a variety of filesystem formats as needed. This flexibility is essential for managing data on different storage devices and maintaining the integrity of your files.

## Step 23: Configuring the GRUB Bootloader

Configuring the GRUB bootloader is a crucial step in setting up your Gentoo Linux system for booting. GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is responsible for managing the boot process and allows you to choose which operating system to start. In this step, we'll configure and install GRUB for your Gentoo installation.

### Edit make.conf for GRUB

First, we need to specify the GRUB platform as "efi-64" in your `make.conf` file. This is essential for systems that use EFI for booting. To do this, execute the following command:

```shell
echo 'GRUB_PLATFORMS="efi-64"' >> /etc/portage/make.conf
```

This command appends the `GRUB_PLATFORMS` setting to your `make.conf` file, ensuring that GRUB is configured correctly for EFI booting.

### Install GRUB

Now that we've configured GRUB, we need to install it on your system. Use the following command to install the GRUB bootloader:

```shell
emerge --ask --verbose sys-boot/grub
```

This command tells Gentoo's package manager, Portage, to install the `sys-boot/grub` package, which includes the GRUB bootloader.

#### Install GRUB to the EFI Partition

To ensure that your system can boot using the UEFI firmware, we'll install GRUB to the EFI partition. Use the following command to accomplish this:

```shell
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/efi
```

This command installs GRUB for the x86_64 EFI target architecture and specifies the EFI directory as `/efi`. It ensures that the necessary GRUB files are placed in the EFI partition, making them accessible to the UEFI firmware during the boot process.

#### Generate the GRUB Configuration File

The final step in configuring GRUB is to generate the GRUB configuration file, `grub.cfg`. This file contains the menu entries and settings required for booting into your Gentoo installation. Use the following command to generate the configuration file:

```shell
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

This command creates the `grub.cfg` file in the `/boot/grub` directory. It detects the installed operating systems and generates a boot menu based on the available options.

With these configurations and tools in place, your Gentoo Linux system is well-prepared for use. The GRUB bootloader is set up to handle the boot process, allowing you to select Gentoo Linux or other operating systems when you start your computer. You're now ready to finalize the installation and configure your user account.

## Step 24: Unmounting Partitions

As you near the completion of your Gentoo Linux installation, it's essential to unmount the various partitions and directories associated with the installation process. This ensures that your system is prepared for a clean and successful reboot.

```shell
exit
cd ~
```

### Unmounting Specific Directories

To begin, unmount specific directories within the Gentoo installation by executing the following command:

```shell
umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}
```

- `umount -l /mnt/gentoo/dev{/shm,/pts,}`: This command unmounts several directories within the Gentoo installation, including `/dev`, `/dev/shm`, and `/dev/pts`. Unmounting these directories is essential to detach them from the installation environment.

### Unmounting the Entire Gentoo Installation

Next, unmount the entire Gentoo installation from the `/mnt/gentoo` directory using the following command:

```shell
umount -R /mnt/gentoo
```

- `umount -R /mnt/gentoo`: This command recursively unmounts all filesystems and directories within the `/mnt/gentoo` directory. It ensures that every component of the Gentoo installation is properly detached from the system.

## Step 25: Reboot Your System

With all the necessary unmounting completed, it's time to reboot your system to initiate the use of the newly installed Gentoo Linux.

```shell
reboot
```

- `reboot`: Execute this command to reboot your system gracefully. After the reboot, you'll encounter the GRUB menu, which allows you to select your desired operating system. Use the arrow keys to highlight "Gentoo" and then press Enter to boot into your freshly installed Gentoo Linux system.

Rebooting is the final step in the installation process, and once your system restarts, you'll have access to your new Gentoo Linux environment. Congratulations on successfully installing Gentoo!

### What I want to say

Installing Gentoo for the first time was quite an experience. It wasn't particularly difficult to set up, but what did catch me off guard was the extensive compilation process that spanned over half a day. Personally, I have a preference for compiling over using pre-built packages, but it really comes down to your own preferences.

However, one thing that stands out about this distribution is its perfection, especially for those well-versed in Linux. For the average user, though, it might not be the first choice. I'd like to highlight that installing Gentoo is quite time-consuming. To put it in perspective, while you can have Arch Linux up and running in about 10 minutes, Gentoo will easily take you half a day to get everything set up. It's a labor of love for sure.

Finally I want to say:

```shell
btw i use Arch and Gentoo!
```

-- Arch & Gentoo user
