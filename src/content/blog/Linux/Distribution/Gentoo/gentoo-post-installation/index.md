## Introduction

In our previous article, we accomplished the installation of XFCE with XORG, setting the stage for a functional Gentoo Linux system. Now, as we delve into this comprehensive post-installation guide, we'll lead you through pivotal steps aimed at elevating the security, functionality, and performance of your Gentoo setup. By the time we wrap up, you'll have a fully operational Gentoo Linux system tailored to meet your daily computing needs.

## User Management

During the installation process, you primarily used the root account for configuration tasks. However, for improved security and easier system management, it's essential to create a dedicated user account for everyday use.

In addition, As a long-time Linux user, I don’t think there is any need to explain why it is necessary to use normal user as your daily account.

### Create a User Account

Follow these steps to create a new user account. Replace `<username>` with your desired username:

```bash
# Create a new user with necessary group memberships and set the shell to /bin/bash
useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio -s /bin/bash <username>
```

- `useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio -s /bin/bash <username>`: This command creates a new user account with the specified username (`<username>`) and assigns it to essential groups, including "users," "wheel," and "audio." The `-m` flag ensures a home directory is created for the user, and the `-s /bin/bash` flag sets the user's default shell to `/bin/bash`.

Next, set the user's password:

```shell
passwd <username>
```

After completing this step, you have a complete daily user. However, you do n’t have to wait when you need to enter the instructions after each sudo. The time is 0 seconds.

### Switch to the New User

To complete the user setup and start using your new user account, switch to the newly created user with the following command:

```bash
# Switch to the newly created user
su - <username>
```

So that you can switch your current user with `su` command.

### 2. Installing `sudo` for Administrative Tasks

It’s really troublesome without the sudo tool, so it must be installed. By default, Gentoo doesn't include `sudo`. However, `sudo` is invaluable for performing administrative tasks with elevated privileges. To install `sudo`, use this command:

```bash
emerge --ask --verbose sudo
```

This command installs `sudo` on your system, allowing you to execute administrative commands securely. With `sudo`, you can perform tasks like package management and system configuration without needing to log in as the root user.

### Configure `sudo` Access

To configure `sudo` access for your new user, follow these steps:

```bash
visudo
```

- `visudo`: Use this command to safely edit the sudoers file, which controls who has access to administrative privileges via `sudo`.

Within the sudoers file, locate the line `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` and uncomment it by removing the `#` symbol at the beginning of the line. This action allows users in the "wheel" group to execute commands with sudo privileges:

```bash
# Uncomment the line below to allow users in the wheel group to execute commands with sudo privileges
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

It's also recommended to set a flag `Defaults timestamp_timeout=0` in the sudoers file. This configuration removes the delay when entering the sudo password:

```bash
Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
```

After completing these steps, you have a fully functional user account with sudo privileges. The timeout for password entry when using `sudo` is set to 0 seconds, providing an extra layer of security for your system.

## Useful tools

As you finalize your Gentoo Linux installation, consider adding essential packages to enhance your system's functionality and convenience.

### 1. Install `sysklogd` for System Logging

System logging is crucial for keeping track of system events and activities. `sysklogd` is a reliable tool for managing system logs. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
emerge --ask app-admin/sysklogd
```

After installation, add `sysklogd` to the list of services that start automatically at boot with the following command:

```bash
rc-update add sysklogd default
```

By doing this, `sysklogd` will begin capturing log messages from the early stages of system startup, providing you with a comprehensive record of system events.

### 2. Install `chrony` for Time Synchronization

Accurate timekeeping is crucial for various system functions and services. `chrony` is a reliable tool for time synchronization. To install it, use the following command:

```bash
emerge --ask net-misc/chrony
```

Once `chrony` is installed, add it to the startup services to ensure that your system's time stays accurate:

```bash
rc-update add chronyd default
```

`chronyd` will synchronize your system's time with time servers on the internet, helping to maintain accurate time for various system operations.

### 3. Install `wireless-tools` for Wi-Fi Management (Optional)

If you use Wi-Fi for your network connection, installing `wireless-tools` can be helpful for managing wireless networking. However, if you prefer using a wired LAN connection or don't need Wi-Fi support, you can skip this step.

To install `wireless-tools`, use the following command:

```bash
emerge -av wireless-tools
```

### 4. Install `CPUID2CPUFLAGS` for CPU Optimization

Optimizing software performance for your specific CPU architecture is essential for getting the most out of your hardware. The CPUID2CPUFLAGS utility helps identify CPU-specific flags, which are crucial for compiling software tailored to your CPU. To install it, use this command:

```shell
emerge --ask app-portage/cpuid2cpuflags
```

After installation, run the following command to determine the CPU flags specific to your system:

```shell
cpuid2cpuflags
```

This utility detects your CPU's capabilities and outputs the appropriate flags. These flags will be used during package compilation to ensure optimized performance.

To configure Gentoo to use these CPU flags for all packages, create a file named `00cpu-flags` in the `/etc/portage/package.use/` directory:

```shell
echo "*/* $(cpuid2cpuflags)" > /etc/portage/package.use/00cpu-flags
```

This file specifies the CPU flags for all packages, ensuring that software is compiled to take full advantage of your CPU's capabilities.

### 5. Install `neofetch` for System Information

`neofetch` is a handy utility that provides detailed information about your Gentoo system in a visually appealing way. To install `neofetch`, use the following command:

```bash
emerge -av neofetch
```

Once installed, you can run `neofetch` to quickly view system information, including your distribution, kernel version, CPU, memory, and more. It's a useful tool for getting an overview of your system's configuration.
