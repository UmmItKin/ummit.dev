## Introduction

In the previous article, I demonstrated how to install XFCE. and in this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of installing and configuring GNOME on your Gentoo system. (As shown in the image below):

## Step 1: Select Your Profile

The first step is selecting the profile. Gentoo offers various profiles to cater to different needs. To see the available profiles, run the following command:

```shell
eselect profile list
```

Browse the list and identify the one that matches your requirements. Typically, you'll find a profile like `default/linux/amd64/17.1/desktop/gnome (stable).` Once you've pinpointed your choice, set it as your active profile. Replace the number `6` with the corresponding number from your list:

```shell
eselect profile set 6
```

## Step 2: Configuring make.conf for GNOME Installation

With your chosen Gentoo profile set, it's time to fine-tune your system to ensure a flawless GNOME installation. This step involves configuring your `make.conf` file, which plays a pivotal role in managing package compilation and runtime behavior. Follow these instructions to adjust the necessary settings:

### 1. Open your `make.conf` file

Begin by opening your `make.conf` file in a text editor. You can utilize the "nano" text editor for this task:

```shell
nano /etc/portage/make.conf
```

### 2. Modify your USE flags

Inside the `make.conf` file, you'll find a section for your USE flags. Modify this section to include the following flags, which are essential for an optimized GNOME installation:

```shell
USE="... wayland gtk gnome dbus elogind minimal -X"
INPUT_DEVICES="libinput"
VIDEO_CARDS="qxl"
```

Let's delve into the purpose of each USE flag:

- **wayland:** Enabling this flag extends support for the Wayland display protocol, a contemporary alternative to the aging X11.

- **gtk:** Inclusion of this flag guarantees compatibility with the GTK toolkit, a fundamental requirement for running GNOME applications.

- **gnome:** The presence of this flag communicates your intent to install GNOME, prompting the system to fetch the necessary dependencies.

- **dbus:** Activation of D-Bus support is crucial for establishing seamless communication between applications and the GNOME desktop environment.

- **elogind:** Enabling this flag ensures proper integration with elogind, a critical component for managing user sessions in Gentoo.

- **minimal:** Opting for a minimal installation ensures that only essential GNOME components are included, effectively sidestepping unnecessary bloat.

- **-X:** The exclusion of the `-X` flag signifies that you're not enabling X Window System compatibility, as Wayland serves as the primary display protocol.

By meticulously configuring these variables within your `make.conf` file using the provided settings, you're effectively preparing your system's package management system for a seamless GNOME installation. Each flag serves a distinct purpose, collectively ensuring that GNOME functions optimally within the Gentoo ecosystem.

### 3. Save your changes

After making these modifications, save the changes to your `make.conf` file. In the "nano" text editor, you can typically save changes by pressing "Ctrl + O" and then confirming the file name with "Enter." To exit the editor, press "Ctrl + X."

By meticulously configuring these variables within your `make.conf` file using the provided settings, you're effectively preparing your system's package management system for a seamless GNOME installation. Each flag serves a distinct purpose, collectively ensuring that GNOME functions optimally within the Gentoo ecosystem.

## Step 3: Set Package Versions

To proceed smoothly with the installation, we need to specify the versions of certain packages. This step helps ensure compatibility. Run the following commands to set the desired package versions.

>IMPORTANT: Again, the versions are not necessarily the same, this is just a demonstration of the current version of the commands. To find out what version you need, just run the install gnome base once.

```shell
echo ">=media-libs/clutter-1.8.4-r1 X" > /etc/portage/package.use/clutter
echo ">=gui-libs/gtk-4.10.5 X" > /etc/portage/package.use/gtk
echo ">=x11-libs/gtk+-3.24.8:3.0 X" > /etc/portage/package.use/gtk+
echo ">=dev-cpp/gtkmm-3.24.8:3.0 X" > /etc/portage/package.use/gtkmm
echo ">=x11-base/xorg-server-21.1.8-r2 -minimal" > /etc/portage/package.use/xorg-server
```

## Step 4: Install GNOME Base

Now, let's install the GNOME base packages. Brace yourself; this process can be time-consuming, as it involves compiling over 400 packages. Just take a break :)

```shell
emerge --ask --verbose gnome-base/gnome
```

## Step 5: Update Environment and Profile

With GNOME base successfully installed, update your environment and profile settings to reflect the changes:

```shell
env-update && source /etc/profile
```

## Step 6: Enabling Elogind for Enhanced GNOME Experience

Elogind is a vital component that enhances your GNOME desktop environment, ensuring a seamless and feature-rich experience. It provides essential services for managing user sessions, enabling features like auto-login and power management. Here's how to enable Elogind:

### Add Elogind to the System Startup

Begin by adding Elogind to your system's startup processes. This ensures that Elogind launches with your system during boot-up. Execute the following command:

```shell
rc-update add elogind boot
```

### Start Elogind Now

You can initiate Elogind immediately using the following command:

```shell
rc-service elogind start
```

Enabling Elogind is a crucial step in preparing your Gentoo system to deliver a flawless GNOME desktop experience. Its role in managing user sessions is pivotal, and it paves the way for the activation of various GNOME features.

## Step 7: Installing the Display Manager Initialization Script

To finalize your GNOME setup, you'll need to install the display manager initialization script. This script ensures that your GNOME desktop environment starts efficiently and securely with each system boot:

```shell
emerge --ask --noreplace gui-libs/display-manager-init
```

## Step 8: Configuring the Display Manager

To make GDM (GNOME Display Manager) the default display manager for your system, a quick configuration change is required. Follow these steps:

### Open the Configuration File

Use the nano text editor to open the configuration file for editing:

```shell
nano /etc/conf.d/display-manager
```

### Set GDM as the Default Display Manager

Within the file, locate the `DISPLAYMANAGER` variable and set it to "gdm" like this:

```shell
DISPLAYMANAGER="gdm"
```

### Ensure Automatic Start at Boot

To guarantee that GDM starts automatically during system boot, add it to the default runlevel with the following command:

```shell
rc-update add display-manager default
```

With these configurations in place, you're ready to start the display manager:

```shell
rc-service display-manager start
```

These final steps solidify GDM as your default display manager, ensuring a smooth and reliable GNOME desktop experience.

## Optional: Disabling GNOME Online Accounts

GNOME offers built-in options for seamlessly connecting your online accounts. However, if you prefer not to utilize this feature, you can easily disable it by adjusting your USE flags. Follow these steps to disable GNOME Online Accounts:

### Step 1: Open your `make.conf` file

To begin, open your `make.conf` file using a text editor. You can use the `nano` text editor for this purpose:

```shell
nano /etc/portage/make.conf
```

### Step 2: Modify your USE flags

Inside the `make.conf` file, locate the line containing your USE flags. Add "-gnome-online-accounts" to the list of flags, like so:

```shell
USE="... -gnome-online-accounts"
```

This modification informs Gentoo not to include the GNOME Online Accounts feature during package installations.

### Step 3: Rebuild your packages

Apply the changes you've made to your USE flags by rebuilding your packages. Use the following command:

```shell
emerge --ask --changed-use --update --deep @world
```

This command ensures that your system updates the packages and considers your modified USE flags.

### Step 4: Reboot your system

To activate these changes, simply reboot your Gentoo system. Once completed, you'll notice that the Online Account options have been removed from your GNOME desktop environment.

## Summary

Congratulations! You've successfully installed GNOME on your Gentoo system. Enjoy your gentoo system!
