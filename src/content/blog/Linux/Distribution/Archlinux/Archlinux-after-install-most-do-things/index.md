## Setting Up Arch Linux (Keep update)

Once you have Arch Linux installed, there are a few key tasks you should complete to optimize your experience. Let's walk through them:

As a Arch linux user, installing package is a optinonal task, but it is the common task that you might want to do. Here're some common tasks that you might want to do after installing Arch Linux :)

### 1. Activate Multilib Repositories

Enhance your Arch Linux system's versatility by enabling the multilib repositories, which provide support for running both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Follow these steps to activate multilib repositories:

1. Open your terminal application.

2. Type the following command and press Enter to open the `pacman.conf` file in the vim text editor:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

3. In the text editor, navigate to the `[multilib]` section. It should look similar to this:

   ```plaintext
   [multilib]
   Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
   ```

4. Remove the `#` character at the beginning of the `[multilib]` line to uncomment it.

5. Save the changes you made by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then press Enter. Exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

6. To update the package database and synchronize the multilib repositories for the first time, execute the following command:

```shell
sudo pacman -Sy
```

By completing these steps, you've successfully activated the multilib repositories on your Arch Linux system. This enables you to run a wider range of applications and ensures better compatibility.

### 2. Optimize Package Mirrors with Reflector

Using the original mirrorlist is not the best approach. Since this is not a file location close to your location, however using Reflector you can download these packages directly using the location of the country you want. Here is step:

1. Run the following command to install reflector:

```shell
sudo pacman -S reflector
```

2. getting the lastest 10 mirrors based on your country.

```shell
sudo reflector --verbose --country <your_country> -l 10 --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist --protocol https
```

- `--protocol https`: Specifies to use HTTPS protocol for fetching mirror information.
- `--country <your_country_code>`: Replace `<your_country_code>` with the code of your country (e.g., `us` for the United States, `ca` for Canada).
- `--verbose`: Enables verbose output to see the log of the process.
- `-l 10`: Retrieves the latest 10 mirrors based on specified criteria.
- `--sort rate`: Sorts the mirrors by download rate (speed).
- `--save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`: Saves the optimized mirrorlist to the specified path.

```shell
sudo pacman -Sy
```

By running this command, you'll efficiently optimize your mirrorlist, ensuring faster and more reliable package downloads and update the package database and synchronize the mirrorlist for the first time.

### 3. Enhance Visual Experience

Elevate your Arch Linux environment with captivating visual enhancements. Follow these simple steps to breathe life into your interface:

#### 3.2 Enable "Candy" Animation with `ILoveCandy`

Enhance your download progress visualization with the playful "Candy" animation, reminiscent of a snake eating your progress bar. Follow these steps to enable it:

1. Open your terminal and type the following command, then press Enter:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

2. Inside the text editor, navigate to the `[options]` section.

3. Uncomment this flag to enable the "Candy" Animation:

   ```shell
   ILoveCandy
   ```

4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`, then exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

5. Your process bar will now display the engaging "Candy" animation!

#### 3.3 Infuse Vibrancy with "Color"

Enhance the clarity of your verbose information by enabling colorful output with the "Color" setting. Say goodbye to plain black and white text:

1. Open your terminal application.

2. Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

3. In the text editor, locate the `[options]` section.

4. Uncomment this flag to enable colorful output:

   ```shell
   Color
   ```

5. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`, then exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

#### 3.4 Clearer Verbose Information with "VerbosePkgLists"

Make your package information crystal clear by enabling "VerbosePkgLists." This option separates each package onto its own line, displaying both the old and new versions distinctly:

1. Open your terminal and type the following command, then press Enter:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

2. Inside the text editor, locate the `[options]` section.

3. Uncomment this flag to enable VerbosePkgLists output:

   ```shell
   VerbosePkgLists
   ```

4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`, then exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

### 4. Multi-threaded Package Downloads with `ParallelDownload`

Optimize your package downloads by utilizing multiple threads with `ParallelDownload`. Instead of downloading one file at a time, you can specify the number of concurrent downloads to speed up the process:

1. Open your terminal and type the following command, then press Enter:

   ```shell
   sudo vim /etc/pacman.conf
   ```

2. Inside the text editor, locate the `[options]` section.

3. Add the following line to enable ParallelDownload with, for example, 5 concurrent downloads:

   ```shell
   ParallelDownload 5
   ```

4. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl + S`, then exit the text editor by pressing `Ctrl + X`.

Now you can enjoy faster downloads with the ability to retrieve multiple files simultaneously!
