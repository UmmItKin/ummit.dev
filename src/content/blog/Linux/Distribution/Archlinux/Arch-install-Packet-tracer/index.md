# Introduction

Just today, I was trying to install Packet Tracer on my Arch Linux machine. But from the official website, there is no official release for Arch Linux. Only the `.deb` vesrion.

I was looking for a way to install it without any hassle. I found a way to install it using AUR. So, I thought of sharing it with you guys. In this article, I will show you how to install Packet Tracer on Arch Linux with AUR.

Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that is used for teaching and learning purposes. Also known as CCNA Course Lab, BUt there's no official release for Arch Linux. We need to download that `.deb` file from the official website, let me show you how to install it on Arch Linux.

>I wont be covering the installation of AUR helper, You should familiar with the AUR helper like `yay` or `paru` :)

## Prerequisites

You need to enroll in the Cisco Networking Academy to download the Packet Tracer. and download that file from the official website.

```

## Step 2: Change the directory

Now, change the directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd packettracer
```

## Step 3: Rename the downloaded file

Now, rename the downloaded file to `CiscoPacketTracer822_amd64_signed.deb`. and move it to the cloned repository:.

```bash
mv original_file_name.dev CiscoPacketTracer822_amd64_signed.deb # Rename the file
mv CiscoPacketTracer822_amd64_signed.deb packettracer/ # Move the file to the cloned repository
```

its the step of ensure that the file name is same with the PKGBUILD file.

From the packet tracer, I noticed that its required java runtime environment btw :)
