With your VPS server in hand, it's time to roll up your sleeves and embark on the journey of creating your CS 1.6 gaming paradise. While we won't delve into the intricacies of VPS security (we're here to focus on the gaming action!), let's kick things off by getting you logged into your server.

### Preparing for Server Access

Before we dive into the thrilling world of CS 1.6 setup, you'll need a secure way to access your VPS. This is where SSH (Secure Shell) comes into play. SSH allows you to connect to your server over a secure channel, ensuring that your actions are encrypted and protected from prying eyes.

Your VPS provider will have detailed documentation on how to access your server using SSH. This documentation will include crucial information like the server's IP address, username, and hostname. Make sure to have this information at hand before proceeding.

### Logging In with SSH

Now that you're armed with the necessary information, let's get you logged into your server using SSH. Here's how it's done:

1. **Open a Terminal:** On your local machine, open a terminal. If you're using a Windows machine, you can use tools like PuTTY or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to access SSH.

2. **SSH Command:** In the terminal, use the SSH command along with the provided IP address, username, and hostname to initiate the connection. For example:

   ```shell
   ssh root@<ip> -v
   ```

   Replace `<ip>` with the actual IP address of your VPS server. The `-v` flag adds verbosity, giving you more information about the connection process.

3. **Verify Connection:** After entering the command, you'll be prompted to verify the authenticity of the server's fingerprint. This is a security measure to ensure you're connecting to the correct server. Type `yes` to continue.

4. **Enter Password:** If this is your first time connecting, you'll be prompted to enter the password associated with the specified username (usually `root`). Note that the password won't be visible as you type it.

5. **Welcome to Your VPS:** Congratulations! If all goes well, you should now be logged into your VPS server. You'll see a command prompt indicating that you're ready to start your CS 1.6 adventure.

And there you have it! You've successfully logged into your VPS server using SSH, setting the stage for the exciting journey ahead. In the upcoming parts of this guide, we'll delve into the installation of essential tools and the step-by-step process of setting up your CS 1.6 server, complete with mods and features. Prepare to become the master of your CS 1.6 domain and let the gaming fun begin!

## Step 3: Updating, Upgrading, and Port 22 Access: Laying the Foundation

Now that you're logged into your VPS server, it's time to ensure that your system is up to date and that you have the necessary port access to maintain a seamless connection. In this segment, we'll be using the reliable Ubuntu distribution to guide us through the process. Ubuntu's stability and performance make it an excellent choice for hosting game servers.

### Up to date Your System

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of gaming, let's make sure your system is fresh and up to date. Run the following commands to update, upgrade, and perform a distribution upgrade on your system:

```shell
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```

### Allowing Port 22 Access

Port 22 is the default port for SSH connections, allowing you to securely access your server. To ensure that you don't lock yourself out of your server on subsequent logins, you need to allow traffic on port 22.

Enter the following command to enable SSH access:

```shell
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```

With this rule in place, you're granting permission for SSH traffic to enter through port 22, which means you can log in without any obstacles.

## Step 4: Allowing Server Ports with UFW

Imagine ports as the doorways to your server – they determine what type of traffic is allowed in and out. In this step, we're going to ensure that the necessary port for your CS 1.6 server is open and ready to receive players. Think of it as inviting gamers into your digital arena.

Previously, we used `iptables` to manage ports, but for simplicity's sake, we're introducing `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall), a user-friendly alternative. We're going to allow port 27015 this time, which is a common choice for CS 1.6 servers.

### Installing and Enabling UFW

First things first, let's install `ufw` and enable it to ensure it starts up automatically after system boot:

```shell
sudo apt-get install ufw -y
sudo ufw enable
```

### Allowing Port 27015

Now, let's grant access to port 27015, which is a common UDP port used by CS 1.6 servers:

```shell
sudo ufw allow 27015/udp
```

## Step 5: Installing SteamCMD

SteamCMD is for Generate game server files. It allows you to download and update game server files from Steam's content distribution system. In this step, we'll install SteamCMD, which is essential for setting up and maintaining your CS 1.6 server.

To get started, follow these instructions (assuming you're using Ubuntu):

1. **Adding the Multiverse Repository**:

   Multiverse is an Ubuntu repository that contains software packages that aren't officially supported by Canonical but are still maintained by the community. To add the Multiverse repository, run:

   ```shell
   sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
   ```

2. **Installing Required Packages**:

   Before installing SteamCMD, let's make sure your system is ready. Install the necessary packages using the following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
   sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
   sudo apt update -y
   ```

3. **Installing SteamCMD**:

   With the prerequisites in place, you're ready to install SteamCMD:

   ```shell
   sudo apt install lib32gcc-s1 -y
   sudo apt install steamcmd -y
   ```

## Step 6: Installing Game Server Required Files

Your CS 1.6 server needs the necessary game files to function properly. In this step, we'll use SteamCMD to download and install these files.

1. **Open SteamCMD**:

   Launch SteamCMD by entering the following command in your terminal:

   ```shell
   steamcmd
   ```

2. **Login with anonymous**:

   Once SteamCMD is running, log in as an anonymous user with:

   ```shell
   login anonymous
   ```

3. **Install CS 1.6 Server Files**:

   Now that you're logged in, it's time to download and install the CS 1.6 server files. Enter the following commands:

   ```shell
   app_update 90 validate
   ```

   The number `90` corresponds to the CS 1.6 game ID. The `validate` parameter ensures that the files are validated and correctly installed.
   >Notes: You might encounter an error the first time you try to run `app_update 90 validate`. Don't worry, this is a common issue with SteamCMD. Simply try the `app_update 90 validate` command again, and it should work fine.

4. **Exit SteamCMD**:

   Once the server files are downloaded and installed, you can exit SteamCMD by typing:

   ```shell
   exit
   ```

## Step 7: Testing the Server

Now, your CS 1.6 server is set up with the basic game files. However, before you can dive into the action, you need to start the server and ensure everything is running as expected. Let's put your server to the test!

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:

   The CS 1.6 server files are located in the following directory:

   ```shell
   ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/
   ```

   Use the `cd` command to navigate to this directory:

   ```shell
   cd ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:

   With the server files directory as your current location, use the following command to start the CS 1.6 server:

   ```shell
   screen -dmS hlds ./hlds_run -game cstrike +map de_dust2 -port 27015 +maxplayers 32 -insecure
   ```

   Let's break down the components of this command:

   - `-dmS hlds`: This portion of the command sets up a detached screen session named `hlds` for the server process.
   - `./hlds_run`: This command starts the server program.
   - `-game cstrike`: Specifies that the game being run is Counter-Strike 1.6.
   - `+map de_dust2`: Specifies the initial map to load, in this case, `de_dust2.`
   - `-port 27015`: Sets the server's port to 27015.
   - `+maxplayers 32`: Limits the maximum number of players in a game to 32.
   - `-insecure`: Disables Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) for now.

3. **Access Your Server**:

   Once the server is running, it's time to see the fruits of your labor. Launch Counter-Strike 1.6 on your client machine. In the game's console, press the tilde key (`~`) to open the console and enter the following command:

   ```shell
   connect <your_server_ip>:27015
   ```

   Replace `<your_server_ip>` with the actual IP address of your VPS.

   Alternatively, you can search for your server in the server list within the game and connect from there.

4. **detach and Managing the Server**:

   To leave the server running in the background while you exit the terminal, press `Ctrl+A` followed by `Ctrl+D`. This will detach the screen session without stopping the server.

   If you want to return to the server console at any time, use the following command:

   ```shell
   screen -r hlds
   ```

With your server up and running, you've accomplished a major part of the setup process. In the next steps, we'll dive deeper into configuring your server and adding plugins to make it the ultimate CS 1.6 Zombie Plague experience!

   ```shell
   nano ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/cstrike/liblist.gam
   ```

   Inside the file, locate the line that starts with `gamedll_linux` and change it to:

   ```shell
   gamedll_linux `addons/metamod/dlls/metamod.so`
   ```

   After making the change, press `Ctrl + S` to save and then `Ctrl + X` to exit the `nano` editor.

2. **Create plugins.ini**:

   Next, create a new configuration file called `plugins.ini` under the `addons/metamod` directory:

   ```shell
   nano ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/cstrike/addons/metamod/plugins.ini
   ```

   In the newly created file, add the following line:

   ```shell
   linux addons/amxmodx/dlls/amxmodx_mm_i386.so
   ```

   Once again, press `Ctrl + S` to save and then `Ctrl + X` to exit the `nano` editor.

## HTTP Download vs. Server Download: Which Is Faster?

When setting up FastDL for your Counter-Strike 1.6 server, you have the option to allow players to download directly from an HTTP source or from your game server. It's important to consider the speed and efficiency of these methods.

**HTTP Download:**

   - FastDL resources accessed via HTTP URLs are typically faster for players to download. Players connect to the FastDL server directly, which can result in quicker download times, especially for large files like maps and custom sounds.

**Server Download:**

   - When custom content is downloaded directly from your game server, it might take longer, especially if multiple players are simultaneously connecting and downloading resources. This method can lead to slower download speeds and potential delays for players.

To ensure the best gaming experience for your players, it's recommended to set up FastDL with HTTP download support. This way, your custom content will be readily available for players to download at optimal speeds.

## Installing a Web Server for FastDL

To host your FastDL resources via HTTP, you'll need a web server. You can choose between popular options like Apache or Nginx. Here's how to install them

> Notes: Just choice one for your http server. If you want to be more customizable later on, I recommend using nginx.

**Installing Apache:**

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to install Apache:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
   ```

3. **Enabling Apache Service:** After installing Apache, you'll need to enable and start the service. Use the following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo systemctl enable apache2   # Enable Apache service to start on boot
   sudo systemctl start apache2    # Start Apache service
   ```

4. Once installed, Apache's server files are located in the `/var/www/html/` directory.

**Installing Nginx:**

1. Open your terminal.

2. Run the following command to install Nginx:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install nginx -y
   ```

3. **Enabling Nginx Service:** Similarly, for Nginx, you'll need to enable and start the service:

```shell
sudo systemctl enable nginx   # Enable Nginx service to start on boot
sudo systemctl start nginx    # Start Nginx service
```

4. Once installed, Nginx's server files are also located in the `/var/www/html/` directory.

Enabling the service ensures that your web server will automatically start when your system boots up, making your FastDL resources accessible to players connecting to your Counter-Strike 1.6 server.

## Configuring Your Server for FastDL

To enable FastDL on your Counter-Strike 1.6 server, you'll need to configure the `server.cfg` file. Here are the steps:

1. Locate your `server.cfg` file. You can usually find it in the following directory:
   ```shell
   ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life/cstrike/server.cfg
   ```

2. Open `server.cfg` using a text editor of your choice.

3. Add the following line to the file, replacing ``http://your-fastdl-server.com/`` with the actual URL to your FastDL server directory:

   ```shell
   sv_downloadurl `http://your-fastdl-server.com/`
   ```

   This line tells your Counter-Strike 1.6 server to use the specified URL for downloading custom content.

4. Save the changes to the `server.cfg` file.

## **Important Note for Counter-Strike 1.6 Server Owners**

If you're a Counter-Strike 1.6 server owner considering the use of a custom domain through Cloudflare, there's a crucial aspect to keep in mind. Counter-Strike 1.6 does not support HTTPS (TLS) connections, which is essential to understand when working with custom domains and Cloudflare.

Here's what you need to know:

**1. HTTPS (TLS) Not Supported:** Counter-Strike 1.6 relies on plain HTTP connections, not HTTPS (TLS). This means that when players connect to your server, it happens over an unencrypted HTTP connection.

**2. Cloudflare's Proxy Service:** Cloudflare provides a proxy service that, by default, routes traffic through its servers. This can enable HTTPS for your domain, but it also means that all traffic is converted to HTTPS.

**3. Non-Proxy (DNS Only) Status:** To ensure that players can connect to your Counter-Strike 1.6 server, you must set the custom domain to `DNS Only` status in Cloudflare. This configuration will route the traffic directly to your server without going through Cloudflare's proxy servers. This is crucial because, as mentioned, CS 1.6 doesn't support HTTPS, and forcing HTTPS through Cloudflare will result in connection issues.

**4. Maintaining Server Connectivity:** By setting your custom domain to `DNS Only` status in Cloudflare, you ensure that players can connect to your Counter-Strike 1.6 server without any encryption-related problems. This maintains the compatibility required for a seamless gaming experience.

It's essential to follow these steps to guarantee that your custom domain and Cloudflare setup don't interfere with the connectivity of your Counter-Strike 1.6 server. By prioritizing non-proxy (DNS only) status, you'll ensure that players can effortlessly join your server without encountering any obstacles related to HTTPS compatibility.

### DNS Record Configuration for Your Domain

When configuring the DNS record for your domain in Cloudflare, it's crucial to set it to `DNS Only.` This ensures that your domain does not go through Cloudflare's proxy service, allowing you to maintain compatibility with services like Counter-Strike 1.6 that rely on plain HTTP connections.

**DNS Only (No Proxy):** For your domain's DNS record, select the option that specifies `DNS Only` or `No Proxy.` This configuration ensures that traffic to your domain goes directly to your server without being routed through Cloudflare's proxy servers.

While your DNS record remains `DNS Only,` you can still use HTTPS within your HTTP server for secure connections. This means that when someone accesses your website using HTTPS in their browser, your server can deliver content securely over HTTPS. However, it's important to note that your game server, like Counter-Strike 1.6, will continue to use HTTP for resource downloads.

By configuring your DNS record in this way, you strike a balance between maintaining compatibility with older services like Counter-Strike 1.6 and providing secure HTTPS access to your website for modern browsers. This setup allows you to ensure smooth connectivity for all users while keeping your resources accessible via HTTP for older systems.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully transformed your Counter-Strike 1.6 server into an exciting Zombie Plague server complete with AI-controlled Yapb bots, Also using fastdl for HTTP download your server resources.

Now, you can access your server with your custom domain, such as `cs.yourserver.io` or `download.yourserver.io.` Happy gaming!
