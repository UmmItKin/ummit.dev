## Introduction

If you're a Firefox user looking to set a different default search engine in the desktop version, you might have noticed that while this option is available in the mobile version, it's not as straightforward on desktop. By default, you're limited to a set of preset search engine options such as `DuckDuckGo`, `Google`, and `Bing`. lets dive into how you can customize your default search engine in Firefox desktop :)

### Modifying Firefox Configuration

Before we dive into the steps, keep in mind that these instructions involve modifying Firefox's configuration settings, which requires a bit of technical know-how. But don't worry, we'll guide you through the process.

### Step 1: Accessing the Configuration Page

1. Open Firefox and type `about:config` in the address bar.
2. You'll see a warning message about the risks of changing advanced settings. Click on the `Accept the Risk and Continue` button to proceed.
